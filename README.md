**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2022b. Compatible with R2022b and later releases._ 

## Description ##
This curriculum module teaches the fundamental concepts of robotic manipulators (robot arms) using interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html). Topics in this module cover point translations/rotations, transformation matrices, and DH parameters. Learn and explore how to make a robotic arm move!

These modules connect the theory and application of the specific subject, which will support various student learning objectives. These lessons can be used as part of a lecture to supplement learning, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed outside class.

## Get started with the Robotic Manipulators interactive examples ##

**Option 1: Download to Desktop** Download and unzip the repository. Then, double-click the RoboticManipulators.prj file inside MATLAB&reg;. 

**Option 2: [Open in MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Robotic-Manipulators&project=RoboticManipulators.prj)** Log in to your MathWorks account to access your license. If you are associated with a university, use your university email to access a license.

- From there, you can follow the landing page instructions to get started with the examples. 
- The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. 
- Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. 
- To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, if a loop is running longer than intended), click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/182219991-17ef7bf9-369b-4463-8de6-9e440ca3bc9b.png"> **Stop** button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
These scripts assume some familiarity with basic linear algebra and coordinate systems. It is possible to work through this module without extensive experience in MATLAB and Simulink.
